v0.10.0:
  * Initial LMAP scheduler support.  simet-ma now requires
    the simet-lmapd package to be installed, or measurements
    won't run.  Crontab and boot services are still required
    for critical administrative tasks that must not (or cannot)
    depend on lmapd.

v0.9.1:
  * Docker container support/examples (build and run)
  * Some documentation added to docs/

v0.9.0:
  * First public release.  BETA code, which will still undergo
    several relevant changes.
