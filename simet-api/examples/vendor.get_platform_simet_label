#
# This is an example of vendor/get_platform_simet_label, usually installed
# either at /opt/simet/lib/simet/vendor or /usr/lib/simet/vendor.
#
# Returns the device's pairing secret ("Etiqueta SIMET") *when it is a printed
# label that the device's owner can read directly*.  While the example is an
# executable script, this could be any executable (e.g. a compiled C program,
# or an executable Lua script).
#
# It should be present when the device has a printed label on its outside with
# a device-unique password or secret, that the owner can read.  If the device
# has no such printed label, this executable SHOULD NOT BE PRESENT in the
# device, or it must return exit status 1.
#
# This script should return in stdout the exact contents of the information
# requested, as printed in the device's label.  In that case, it must return
# exit status 0.
#
# If the requested information cannot be retrieved *at this time* (i.e. it is a
# temporary error), and the system should retry sometime later, it must return
# an exit status other than 0 or 1.  Any functionality that depends on the
# requested information will be unavailable until the attempt is retried and
# succeeds.
#
# NOTES:
# Error messages must be sent to stderr, never to stdout.
#
# Returning DISABLED on stdout, or an empty stdout, and exit status 0 would
# disable the SIMET virtual label functionality.  This is NOT usually wanted,
# as it forces the device into a stand-alone mode that cannot meaningfully
# interact with any of the SIMET web portals.
#
# It must return status 2 for requests of unknown resouces (see below).
#
#
# Command line:
# get_platform_simet_label <resource requested>
#
# resources:
# vlabel   -   SIMET pairing secret ("etiqueta SIMET")
#
# example:
# FOO=$(get_platform_simet_label vlabel) && echo "The SIMET label is: $FOO"
