Main TODO:

 ! Move to a lmapd-based scheduling core and extension system
   + Teach json to lmapd to avoid libxml2 runtime cost on embedded

 * Unify the common source and functions and while at it clean up
   and consolidate the build system.

 * Drop the use of libubox, we want more visibility to the underlying
   details than it gives us, and it doesn't do everything we need it to
   anyway.

 * Write proper lua or C replacements for shell hacks.

 * O.S./hardware timestamping for LAN measurement (Internet
   measurements are too coarse to need this).

 * Refactor most of the code as we go, much of it is basically a
   working prototype... and nauseating to look at for too long.

 * Add all the missing functionality ;-)

 * Valgrind is our friend, so we should invite it to tea at every
   "make test".

 * Actually add "make test" (unit tests and systemic tests), use
   "check" for the C unit tests, and a harness for the systemic
   tests.
