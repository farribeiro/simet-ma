Developer notes:

SIMETBOX is an OpenWRT-based measurement system for home routers and such
"big" embedded devices.

Files with "simetbox" in the name are SIMETBOX-specific, they usually have
a "simet" counterpart that is generic.

For a SIMETBOX build, you would typically want this:
  --enable-simetbox --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
(and OpenWRT will already set everything but --enable-simetbox for you)

For a Linux build, watch out for localstatedir, we do -NOT- create
${localstatedir}/lock except in the simet_register_ma.sh script, and this
can become a problem if you also give --prefix to configure and would need
${prefix}/var to be created.

An example of the correct usage is:
--prefix=/opt/simet --localstatedir=/var

Linux builds will use an embedded copy of OpenWRT's jsonpath/jsonfilter
and libubox.  SIMETBOX builds will use the system copy of jsonfilter,
which must be in the system path.


Conventions:

Look into simet-api/Makefile.am for conventions for scripts and config files.

Configuration (after install):
 * Hardcoded defaults go into $LIBDIR/simet/*conf
 * These defaults can be user-overridden through
   $SYSCONFDIR/simet/<same name as above>.conf

Versioning:
  The main version is set by the top level "version" file.  If working from
  a git checkout, it will be based on "git describe" instead (see version.sh).

  Please always commit an up-to-date version file and then tag the new release:

  echo "v1.2.3" > version ; git add version ; git commit -m "version: update" ; git tag -m "simet-ma version $(cat version)" $(cat version)
