Files with "simetbox" in the name are SIMETBOX-specific, they usually have a "simet" counterpart that is generic.

<subdir>/conf/ is for the stuff that should end up installed in $CFGDIR (typically /etc/simet/), but this is
handled by (cd <subdir> ; make install), so it is only a convention.

<subdir>/Makefile support (defined as MAKEFILE variables at the top level):
  PREFIX      [/opt/simet]  : the root of nearly everything because they will default to $PREFIX/<something>
  BINDIR      [$PREFIX/bin] : CLI binaries (main executables), CLI scripts (main executables)
  LIBDIR      [$PREFIX/lib] : arch-specific components
  SYSCONFDIR  [$PREFIX/etc] : config root.
  DESTDIR     [""]          : Prefixes every install path *only* during make install.

  plus the usual GNU stuff (refer to autoconf and cmake)

NOTE: simet config goes into $SYSCONFDIR/simet/<foo>.  simet components, to $LIBDIR/simet/<foo>.
I.e. they are prefixed by "simet/".

For SIMETBOX:
  PREFIX=/usr
  SYSCONFDIR=/etc

For distros (everything under /opt), or simetbox-like.
  PREFIX=/opt


AUTOCONF:
  Because we need proper cross-build support from OpenWRT, the toplevel has a
  ./configure script that is an alternative way to autotool and configure all
  subprojects.  OpenWRT uses it automatically, and the toplevel Makefile
  notices the subproject has been already autoconf'd, and doesn't overwrite it.

VERSIONING:
  when a subproject does not have its own version number, it should use the
  version set in AGENT_VERSION (makefile variable)
  This variable is set from <toplevel>/version
