Files with "simetbox" in the name are SIMETBOX-specific, they usually have a
"simet" counterpart that is generic.

For a SIMETBOX build, ensure you configure everything with --enable-simetbox


Conventions:

look into simet-api/Makefile.am for conventions for scripts and config files.

NOTE: simet config goes into $SYSCONFDIR/simet/<foo>.  simet components, to $LIBDIR/simet/<foo>.
I.e. they are prefixed by "simet/".

VERSIONING:
  subdirs that are independent have their own versions, set in the CMakefile or in configure.ac.
  the main version is set by the toplevel configure.ac AC_INIT.
