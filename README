Files with "simetbox" in the name are SIMETBOX-specific, they usually have a
"simet" counterpart that is generic.

For a SIMETBOX build, ensure you configure everything with --enable-simetbox


Conventions:

look into simet-api/Makefile.am for conventions for scripts and config files.

NOTE: simet config goes into $SYSCONFDIR/simet/<foo>.  simet components, to $LIBDIR/simet/<foo>.
I.e. they are prefixed by "simet/".

VERSIONING:
  The main version is set by the toplevel "version" file.  If working from
  a VCS checkout, it will be based on "git describe" instead (see version.sh).

  Please always commit an up-to-date version file and then tag the new release:

  echo "v1.2.3" > version ; git add version ; git commit -m "version: update" ; git tag -m "simet-ma version $(cat version)" $(cat version)
