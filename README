Developer notes:

Files with "simetbox" in the name are SIMETBOX-specific, they usually have a
"simet" counterpart that is generic.

For a SIMETBOX build, you would typically want this:
  --enable-simetbox --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
(and openwrt will already set everything but --enable-simetbox for you)

For a Linux build, watch out for localstatedir, we do -NOT- create
${localstatedir}/lock and this can become a problem if $prefix is set.  An
example of the correct usage is: --prefix=/opt/simet --localstatedir=/var


Conventions:

look into simet-api/Makefile.am for conventions for scripts and config files.

Configuration:
 * Hardcoded under $LIBDIR/simet/*conf
 * User-overriden through $SYSCONFDIR/simet/<same name as above>.conf

Versioning:
  The main version is set by the toplevel "version" file.  If working from
  a git checkout, it will be based on "git describe" instead (see version.sh).

  Please always commit an up-to-date version file and then tag the new release:

  echo "v1.2.3" > version ; git add version ; git commit -m "version: update" ; git tag -m "simet-ma version $(cat version)" $(cat version)
